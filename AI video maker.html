<h1>&nbsp;Advantage:AI technology can be used to improve video quality and content generation. Using AI technology, videos can be optimized for specific screen sizes, network speeds and devices. In addition, AI can also help video producers generate more creative content, and generate high-quality videos by generating images and audio, automatic editing, etc. These technologies not only make the video production process faster and more efficient.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;Disavantage:AI needs a large knowledge base to identify various video elements and semantics. Video itself requires art and aesthetics, which AI cannot surpass.&nbsp;</h1>
